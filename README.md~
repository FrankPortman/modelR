Deploy &amp; Monitor ML Models directly from R


### annoying shit for now

- you must clear previous_inputs.log every time if you want to refresh the app
- you MUST kill the previous deploy.R process since shiny won't do it. working on this
  - ps aux | grep deploy.R and then kill that process
- test the reactive file reader with the bash file
